# The german translation of the IRMA app

The german translation of the IRMA app (see www.irma.app) consists of two parts:

1. The translation of the app itself: the de.json in the app-de folder
2. The translation of the scheme-files that are used by the app: the eight .xml files in the pbdf-schememanager-de folder that have the `<IsInCredentialStore>true</IsInCredentialStore>` tag

The translations have been created by @gusblock and revised by @CreativeCode (with support by friends and family and feedback from PbdF).
